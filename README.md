# Hasura-task

## task 1
task 1 contains a function which takes N,M and the object of magic numbers as inputs. I have not implemented the console input functionality so the values can be changed  from the function call parameters itself.

The code can be run using :-
`node task1.js`

## task 2
I have not implemented the pdf version of the output but I have simulated a similar behavior by creating an array consisting of the images to display on the pdf. The array represents the simulation of the pages for the pdf.
The output array contains the information that would be printed on the corresponding pdf pages.
Since it is a function so arguments can be provided to the function call itself.

The program can be run using:-
`node task2.js`
